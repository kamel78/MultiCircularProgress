Embarcadero-Rad Studio Visual component that implements a circular progress bar with multiple slices.
The component is customizable: number of tracks, background color, progress color, progress text settings and two progress styles. All are illustrated in the demo application (no need to install the package to run the demo app, the unit is included to create the component at run time).

Remarks and bugs report are welcome.
